## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a data analyst actively practicing and refining my skills in SQL, Python, and Power BI by working with real-world datasets. This repository is a space where I explore data, uncover insights, and build visual stories that bring numbers to life.

My approach to data analysis starts with asking the right questions and ends with delivering meaningful answers through clear visuals and well-documented code. I use SQL to extract, filter, and join data from relational databasesâ€”ensuring accurate, clean inputs for analysis. With Python, I dive deeper into data wrangling, statistical exploration, and automation using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Power BI helps me transform complex findings into interactive dashboards that are both informative and visually compelling.

These projects are based on real-world datasets, covering topics like sales performance, customer behavior, public data, and more. Each one is designed to strengthen my analytical thinking and technical proficiencyâ€”while building a portfolio of work that reflects both curiosity and a practical mindset.

Iâ€™m continuously learning how to better communicate insights, optimize queries, and design visuals that support smarter decision-making. Whether itâ€™s exploring trends, forecasting outcomes, or identifying patterns, I focus on delivering clear, data-driven conclusions.

This repository is a work in progress, just like my journey as a data analyst. If youâ€™re also passionate about data, feel free to check out the projects, share feedback, or connect to collaborate.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to growing as analysts, one dataset at a time.
